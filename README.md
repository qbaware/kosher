## Description
Do you
- :sunglasses: use multiple browsers, like Firefox and Chrome? 
- :boom: have tens or hundreds of opened tabs on each browser? 
- :expressionless: feel annoyed that you can't access a certain tab because it's on the other browser? 
- :unamused: get annoyed of the duplication of tabs on both browsers, when you do manage to open the same tab in the other browser?
- :sweat: experience another issue caused by using multiple browsers?

Kosher aims to resolve all of those issues by providing users a unified way to sync all of their tabs in a single place.
