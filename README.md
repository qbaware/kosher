## Description

Do you

- :sunglasses: use multiple browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, and on multiple machines too?
- :boom: have tens or hundreds of opened tabs everywhere?
- :expressionless: feel annoyed that you can't access a certain tab because it's on the other browser, and potentially on another machine?
- :unamused: get annoyed of the duplication of tabs on both browsers, when you do manage to open the same tab in the other browser?
- :sweat: experience another issue caused by using multiple browsers on multiple machines?

Kosher aims to resolve all of those issues by providing users a unified way to sync all of your machines' browser tabs in a single place.

Kosher is a cross-browser extension that stores all your browser tabs into the cloud. This makes it possible to use browser tabs across other browsers on other machines. It also has the benefit of being a secure backup storage for your browser tabs in case of an issue with the browser.

## Note

This repository is not actively maintained and I would consider it in a draft-ish state, although the backend works great and the frontend (the browser extension(s)) as well.

It still missing docs, a guide on how to connect it to Supabase (PostgreSQL, my choice of a SQL DB), how to deploy the backend services, how to run it fully locally, etc.
